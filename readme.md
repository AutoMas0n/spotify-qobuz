## spotify-qobuz

This project helps you transfer your Spotify Discover Weekly playlist to Qobuz.

**How it works:**
1. Run `spotify_discover.py` to create `discover_weekly_tracks.json` containing your Discover Weekly tracks from Spotify.
2. Run `qobuz_copy_discover.py` to read that JSON and add the tracks to your Qobuz account.

Simple, fast, and effective for keeping your music in sync between Spotify and Qobuz.
